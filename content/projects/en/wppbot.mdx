## The Challenge

More than 10,000 educational system agents (teachers, principals, administrative staff) **lacked an official**, instant, and automated communication channel for inquiries.

This generated an unsustainable operational load in administrative offices, which had to answer thousands of repetitive queries via phone or email, leaving users without support outside of office hours.

The challenge was to create a massive, scalable, and reliable channel on the platform everyone uses (WhatsApp) that was intelligent enough to manage the complexity and volume of inquiries.

## The Solution: A Hybrid AI Agent

A chatbot system was developed using `Node.js` and `whatsapp-web.js` acting as a "hybrid AI agent", serving two types of users with two different AI engines:

### 1. AI Assistant for Users (Google Gemini)

This is the public face of the system. An AI instance (Google Gemini via API) trained with the specific context of the CGE.

- **24/7 Support:** Automatically answers most frequent queries (e.g., procedure status, payment dates, procedural guides).
- **Context Management:** Maintains a conversation history to allow for natural and coherent dialogue, understanding the flow of the user's inquiry.
- **Operational Filter:** Acts as the first line of defense, resolving 80-90% of inquiries without human intervention.

### 2. AI Assistant for Administrators (GPT)

A productivity "backdoor" for the management team, accessible only with administrator permissions.

- **General Purpose AI (GPT):** Integrated via *Magic Loops*, allows an administrator to use advanced AI (GPT) for internal tasks, such as drafting statements, analyzing data, or debugging code, all from the same WhatsApp interface.

- **Flexible Context Management:** Allows "breaking out of context" from the CGE to use the AI as a general productivity tool without contaminating the user bot's history.

## The Impact

- **Creation of the First Official Channel:** Established the CGE's first massive, automated, and official communication medium, serving thousands of users instantly.
- **Operational Load Reduction:** Estimated reduction of over 80% in phone and email inquiries regarding frequent topics, freeing up administrative staff for higher-value tasks.
- **24/7 Support:** Teachers and principals now have access to critical information anytime, anywhere.
- **Productivity Platform:** The administrator module became an internal AI tool for the management team, improving their efficiency.

## Future Roadmap

- Integration with internal databases to provide personalized responses.
- Implementation of *push* notifications for urgent announcements.
- Expand AI training (Gemini) with a deeper regulatory corpus.
