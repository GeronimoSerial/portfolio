## Novelty Sheets Management System

**Problem · Solution · Impact**  
**Date:** March 2024 - Present  
**Client:** Consejo General de Educación de Corrientes

---

## Problem

The Consejo General de Educación faced structural challenges in the monthly management of novelty sheets for teaching and non-teaching staff:

- **Manual and decentralized processes** (paper, scattered sheets, email)
- **High scale:** >1000 establishments, thousands of agents, monthly execution
- **Lack of source validations**, generating errors in later stages
- **Zero traceability:** no clear states, no progress visibility, no responsible parties
- **High operational cost** for supervisors and central areas
- **Systemic risk:** inconsistencies with direct impact on salary settlements

The technical challenge was not just to digitize, but to design a production-ready system capable of absorbing volume, reducing errors, and correctly modeling the domain.

---

## Solution

Implementation of a centralized, process-oriented web system, focused on data integrity, early validation, and separation of responsibilities.

### Key features

**Standardized monthly cycle**  
Flow with defined states: pending → submitted → observed → validated, with explicit business rules on what can be modified and when.

/>

**Real-time validations**  
Syntactic and semantic controls at loading time, preventing inconsistent states from the frontend to the domain layer.

**Observability and metrics**  
Compliance status visible in real time by school, supervisor, locality, and period.

**Role-based management**  
Clear identification of actors and responsibilities (school, supervisor, central area) with permissions and actions defined by state.

**Complete audit**  
Registration of all transitions, observations, and corrections for institutional traceability.

## Tech Stack

<TechStackSection />

**Architecture:** Separation by layers (actions / services / repositories) with clear contracts to minimize coupling and facilitate changes.

---

## Impact

### Key metrics

- **1000+ establishments** incorporated into the system
- **Significant reduction** of loading errors in the first year
- **Real-time visibility** of the process status at provincial scale
- **Analytical base** prepared for institutional dashboards and historical analysis
- **Reusable infrastructure** for other administrative processes

---

## Digital transformation

### Before

- Manual processes with paper and scattered sheets
- Late validations in later stages of the cycle
- No visibility of process progress
- Manual corrections with high operational cost
- Risk of errors in salary settlements

### After

- Centralized flow with defined states and source validations
- Immediate observability by school, supervisor, and period
- Auditable system with complete traceability
- Change-oriented design and functional scalability
- Solid foundation for data-driven decisions

---

## Key results

### Integrity and reliability

- **Early validation:** Moving the error as close to the source as possible reduces manual reprocessing
- **Finite states and controlled transitions:** Eliminate ambiguity and create explicit responsibility
- **Explicit domain modeling:** Reduces conceptual debt and avoids scattered logic

### Scalability and maintainability

- **Layered architecture:** Facilitates incorporation of new functionalities without structural refactoring
- **Clear contracts between layers:** Minimize coupling and production change risks
- **Process-oriented design:** Prepared to evolve with new metrics and reports

### Institutional impact

- **Greater operational predictability** for critical areas (HR, settlements)
- **Immediate visibility** of the process status at provincial scale
- **Reduction of administrative burden** for supervisors and central areas
- **Foundation for institutional analytics** and detection of operational patterns

---

## Architecture and design

### Domain modeling

Explicit representation of the monthly sheet cycle with:

- **Defined and finite states:** pending → submitted → observed → validated
- **Encapsulated business rules:** what can be modified and when
- **Actor identification:** school, supervisor, central area with differentiated permissions

### Software architecture

- **Separation by layers:** actions / services / repositories
- **Clear contracts** between layers to minimize coupling
- **Normalized persistence** prepared for analytical queries
- **Change-oriented design** that does not require structural refactoring for new functionalities

The architecture prioritizes readability, maintainability, and low production change risk.

---

## Learnings and next steps

### What worked

- Domain and real process-oriented approach, not isolated forms
- Real-time validations with immediate user feedback
- Observability integrated from design, not as a later functionality
- Pragmatic architecture without over-engineering

### Challenges overcome

- Historical data migration from multiple manual sources
- Definition of states and transitions that reflect the real process
- Optimization for slow connections in rural areas
- User training in a new workflow

### Roadmap 2025-2026

- Direct integration with salary settlement system
- Analytical dashboards with anomaly and pattern detection
- Automatic notifications of states and observations
- API for integration with other institutional systems
