## CGE Institutional Portal & Digital Transformation

**The Challenge · The Solution · The Impact**
**Period:** July 2023 – Present
**Client:** General Council of Education of Corrientes

---

## The Challenge

The General Council of Education faced critical challenges in its communication and management:

- **Fragmented information:** Multiple channels with no traceability or single source of truth.
- **Limited access:** Difficulty for principals, teachers, and the public to access regulations, documents, and guides.
- **Manual processes:** High operational load and inconsistent response times for administrative procedures.
- **Disjointed communication:** Lack of a consolidated public-facing reference for the institution.
- **Absence of metrics:** Inability to measure the efficiency and satisfaction of services.

---

## The Solution

The **[consejo.mec.gob.ar](https://consejo.mec.gob.ar)** portal was designed and implemented as the central platform for communication and digital services.

The goal was threefold: **centralize** institutional information, **digitize** key processes, and **provide** a transparent and accessible communication channel for the entire provincial educational community.

### Main Modules

* **News & Announcements:** Official dissemination center with automated categorization and advanced semantic search.
* **Digitized Procedures:** Interactive step-by-step guides for 45+ administrative procedures, designed to reduce errors.
* **Official Documents:** Centralized repository for regulations, resolutions, and manuals with version control and auditing.
* **School Directory:** Complete directory of educational institutions by department, with real-time updated data.
* **Regulatory Chatbot:** A 24/7 automated assistant to resolve frequent queries about regulations and procedures.
* **Institutional Contact:** A ticket system for formal inquiries, ensuring a response SLA and case tracking.
