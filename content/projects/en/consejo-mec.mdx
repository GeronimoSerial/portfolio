## Institutional Web Portal of the General Council of Education

**Problem · Solution · Impact**  
**Date:** July 2023 – Present  
**Client:** General Council of Education of Corrientes

---

## Problem

The General Council of Education faced critical challenges in managing and communicating institutional information:

- **Fragmented information** across multiple channels with no traceability or single source of truth
- **Limited access** for school principals, teachers, and the public to regulations, official documents, and operational guides
- **Manual administrative processes** with a high operational workload and inconsistent response times
- **Fragmented institutional communication** with no consolidated public-facing reference
- **Lack of metrics** to measure efficiency and satisfaction across services

---

## Solution

We implemented the portal **[consejo.mec.gob.ar](https://consejo.mec.gob.ar)** as a unified platform for institutional communication and digital services for the provincial education community.

---

### Main Modules
---

**News & Announcements**  
Official dissemination center with automated categorization and semantic search.
---

**Digitized Procedures**  
Step-by-step guides for 45+ administrative procedures, reducing errors and processing times.
---

**Official Documents**  
Central repository of regulations, resolutions, and manuals with full version control.
---

**Schools Directory**  
Complete directory of educational institutions by department, updated in real time.
---

**Regulatory Chat**  
Automated assistant for common queries with 72% accuracy without human intervention.
---

**Institutional Contact**  
Ticketing system for inquiries with a 3-business-day SLA and full case tracking.
---

## Tech Stack

<TechStackSection />

**Roadmap:** Integration with a headless CMS (Strapi/Directus) and CGE internal systems (payroll, teacher vacancies, and internal databases).

---

## Impact

<ImpactGrid />

### Key Metrics

- **28,500+ monthly active users** (+42% year-over-year)
- **1,200+ publications and resources** continuously updated
- **45 digitized procedures** with guided workflows
- **2.8 days average response time** (-35% compared to manual processing)

---

## Project Evolution

**July 2023: Portal launch**  
Consolidation of scattered institutional information into a single official access point.

**September 2023: Regulatory Chat integration**  
Automated assistant implemented to resolve frequent normative questions.

**January 2024: Mobile-first optimization**  
Responsive redesign and compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

**June 2024: Systems integration**  
Connection to CGE internal databases for real-time queries and data retrieval.

---

## Digital Transformation

### Before

- Information spread across multiple channels with no traceability
- Repetitive phone inquiries burdening staff
- No standardized satisfaction metrics or response times
- Limited access only during administrative hours

### After

- Unified portal with SSR and centralized content
- 24/7 automated chat resolving 72% of queries
- Analytics dashboard with real-time metrics
- Permanent availability from any device

---

## Key Results

### Centralization & Transparency

- **Single source of truth:** All institutional information consolidated in a 24/7 accessible official portal
- **Full traceability:** Audit trail for all publications, documents, and regulatory updates
- **Equitable access:** Device-agnostic availability for the whole educational community

### Operational Efficiency

- **Reduced manual workload:** Digitized procedures lowered phone inquiries by ~40%
- **Improved response times:** 2.8 days average SLA vs. 4.3 days previously
- **Automated query handling:** 72% of queries resolved without human intervention via the regulatory chat

### Scalability & Evolution

- **Future-ready architecture:** Modular design enables integration with internal CGE systems
- **Data-driven decisions:** Analytics dashboard to guide content and feature prioritization
- **Foundation for digital transformation:** Platform established as the basis for future services

### Impact on the Educational Community

The portal became the official reference channel for:

- **School administrators:** Immediate access to regulations and operational guides
- **Teachers:** Information on training, calls for applications, and administrative procedures
- **Citizens:** Transparency in provincial education administration and access to public data

---

## Learnings & Next Steps

### What worked

- User-centered design with an intuitive navigation
- Prioritization of critical content (procedures, regulations)
- Gradual implementation of complex features (regulatory chat)

### Challenges overcome

- Migration of historical content from multiple sources
- Internal training for autonomous content management
- Performance improvements for low-bandwidth rural internet

### Roadmap 2025–2026

- Integration with the teacher vacancies management system
- Self-service portal for teachers (payroll viewing, online procedures)
- Mobile app for push notifications about urgent calls
- Expand the regulatory chat with advanced NLP capabilities
