## Data Survey and Analysis Platform (PRAD)

**The Challenge · The Solution · The Impact**

**Period:** 2024 – Present

**Client:** Ministry of Education of Corrientes, Argentina.

---

## The Challenge

The Ministry of Education and the General Council of Education (CGE) needed a way to **centralize and understand** the vast amount of data generated by schools across the province.

- **Decentralized Data:** Critical information (enrollment, infrastructure, staff, key issues) was collected in thousands of isolated Google Forms and spreadsheets.
- **Difficulty of Analysis:** It was impossible for supervisors and authorities to get a unified, real-time provincial overview.
- **Information Overload:** Identifying the most urgent issues among "thousands of possibilities" was a manual, slow, and subjective process, hindering efficient resource allocation.

---

## The Solution

The **Data Survey and Analysis Platform (PRAD)** was designed and developed—a centralized system that ingests, processes, and analyzes information from provincial surveys.

The platform is fed by ingesting data from Google Forms (using +50 data points per institution, including CUE, enrollment, staff, infrastructure, and connectivity) and transforms it into actionable intelligence.

### Main Modules

* **Supervision Dashboard:** Visualization components that render information clearly and are filterable, allowing supervisors and authorities to see the status of their areas at a glance.
* **Statistics & Graphics (BI) Module:** Converts numerical data (enrollment numbers, teacher counts, etc.) into readable charts that facilitate understanding of issues at the provincial, departmental, or school level.
* **AI Prioritization Engine:** The core of the platform. An AI-powered analysis system that filters thousands of reported issues and ranks them by urgency, based on the business rules and priority criteria defined by the institution.

## Tech Stack

<TechStackSection />

**Key Architecture:** The solution uses **Google Apps Script** and the **Google Sheets API** for automated data ingestion from the forms. The processed data is served to a React frontend for visualization.

      <li>Proactive, data-driven decision-making</li>
    </ul>

## The Impact

- **Informed Decision-Making:** Authorities can now make strategic decisions based on real, unified, and updated data from the entire province.
- **Intelligent Prioritization:** The AI module allows the CGE to focus resources on the schools or areas with the most critical issues, optimizing time and budget.
- **Total Visibility:** Supervisors have immediate access to a complete "x-ray" of their zone, improving management and follow-up.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Hundreds of manual labor hours previously spent consolidating and trying to understand scattered data were eliminated.

## Future Roadmap

- Migrate data ingestion from Google Forms to an internal API for greater control and scalability.
- Expand the AI module to include predictive analysis (e.g., predicting schools at risk of dropout).
- Integrate the platform with other internal Council systems.
