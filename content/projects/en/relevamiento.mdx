## Government Data Management

Relevamiento is a comprehensive data management platform specifically designed for governmental census and survey operations. The system streamlines the collection, validation, and analysis of data from educational establishments across the province.

This platform addresses the complex challenges of large-scale data collection in the public sector, providing tools that ensure data accuracy, completeness, and timely reporting for educational planning and policy decisions.

## Key Capabilities

The platform provides end-to-end management of survey campaigns, from initial setup and distribution to final analysis and reporting. It supports multiple survey types and adapts to various data collection scenarios commonly encountered in educational census operations.

### Data Collection Process

- Streamlined survey workflows
- Real-time data validation
- Multi-user collaboration
- Automated report generation
- Role-based access control
- Offline data collection support
- Data quality checks

The system includes robust validation rules that ensure data quality at the point of entry, reducing errors and the need for subsequent corrections. Real-time dashboards provide visibility into collection progress and data completeness.

## Impact and Results

Since implementation, the platform has significantly improved the efficiency of census operations, reducing data collection time and improving data quality. The automated workflows have freed up staff time for analysis rather than data processing.

The platform's reporting capabilities enable faster generation of statistical reports and insights, supporting evidence-based decision-making in educational policy and resource allocation across the province.
