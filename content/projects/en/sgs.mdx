## The Challenge: Critical Problem Analysis

The Family Allowance payment process was an archaic, 100% manual, and paper-based system, generating an unsustainable operational load and a high propensity for errors.

My role was to critically analyze the business rules to identify the fundamental flaws:

- **Lack of traceability and excess paper:** Thousands of physical certificates moved monthly between schools, the CGE, and the Ministry of Finance. There was no audit, no centralized status, and it created a massive storage problem.
- **High manual operational load:** Principals spent weeks collecting, signing, photocopying, and transporting this documentation, diverting valuable resources from pedagogical tasks.
- **Unreliable data and rework:** Validation was visual. An expired certificate, an incorrect CUIT, or an illegible photocopy caused the payment to be rejected, generating delays for the teacher and an enormous manual rework effort.
- **Unscalability:** The system was unable to grow. Each new agent or student added more paper and more manual load to an already collapsed process.

## The Solution: An Integrated Digital System

My responsibility was to design an **integrated digital workflow** that replaced the manual process from end to end. The solution was not a simple form, but an **inter-ministerial system** that unifies databases and validates information automatically.

The project was developed under an inter-ministerial agreement that allowed data interoperability between the CGE, the Systems Directorate, and the Ministry of Finance.

### Pillars of the solution

* **1. Single Source of Truth:** Databases were unified. The system automatically cross-references and validates personal (Finance), school (CGE - Students), and family (Civil Registry/ANSES) information without human intervention.
* **2. Zero-Paper Process:** Institutions no longer accumulate physical certificates. Validation became a digital *flag*. Principals only need to validate or report exceptions on the platform.
* **3. Auditable and Transparent Workflow:** Every change in the agent's status (e.g., 'Validated', 'Sent to Payroll', 'Paid') is recorded in a log, providing complete transparency and traceability.
* **4. Standardized Output:** The system generates a single, clean, and reliable digital batch that is consumed directly by the Finance payroll center, eliminating dispersion.

## Tech Stack

<TechStackSection />

**Key Architecture:** The architecture was based on **interoperability** between systems from different ministries, using secure APIs to cross-reference and validate sensitive data. A business rules engine was designed to automate the validations that previously took weeks.

## The Impact

The result was the complete transformation of a central administrative process, achieving:

- **Total paper reduction:** Institutions stopped accumulating physical certificates. 100% of the transport, photocopying, and storage of paper was eliminated.
- **Liberation of operational load:** Principals no longer gather or submit dozens of photocopies per semester, freeing up that time for pedagogical management.
- **Guaranteed payment continuity:** Delays and rejections due to inconsistencies were eliminated. Teachers receive their salaries without interruptions.
- **Agility in payroll processing:** The payroll center works with a single, standardized, and reliable digital batch, drastically reducing processing time.
- **True scalability:** The platform supports the entry of thousands of agents without increasing the manual load on administrative areas.
