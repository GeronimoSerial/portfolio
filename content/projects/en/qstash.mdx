## Serverless Messaging Platform

QStash is an HTTP-based messaging and scheduling solution specifically designed for serverless and edge runtimes. It provides a robust infrastructure for asynchronous communication between services without requiring complex setup or maintenance.

The platform addresses the unique challenges of serverless architectures where traditional message queue solutions don't fit well due to their stateful nature and complexity.

## Core Features

- 100% serverless, no stateful connections required. Messages are pushed to your API.
- At-least-once delivery guaranteed to any public API
- Publish-subscribe via topics
- Delay message delivery
- Message deduplication
- Scheduling via CRON expressions

## Use Cases

QStash acts as the glue for serverless functions, enabling developers to build powerful distributed systems without managing infrastructure. It decouples services and provides reliable message delivery with automatic retries.

### Real-World Example

Consider an e-commerce application where you need to send a notification email after each purchase. Instead of calling the email service directly from your purchase handler (which creates tight coupling and potential failure points), you can:

1. Send a message to QStash from your purchase service
2. QStash queues the request and calls your email service
3. If the service doesn't respond, QStash automatically retries with backoff
4. The purchase service isn't affected by email service latency

This architecture provides better reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

## Advanced Capabilities

QStash supports delayed message delivery and CRON-based scheduling, enabling use cases like:

- Send a review reminder email 3 days after shipment
- Schedule periodic cleanup tasks
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
- Build complex workflows with delayed stages
